# AI SDK UI Stream Protocols

This project is based on the [AI SDK UI Stream Protocols](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol)

# AI SDK UI: Stream Protocols

AI SDK UI functions such as useChat and useCompletion support both text streams and data streams. The stream protocol defines how the data is streamed to the frontend on top of the HTTP protocol.

This page describes both protocols and how to use them in the backend and frontend.
