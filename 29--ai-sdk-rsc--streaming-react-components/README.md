# AI SDK UI Streaming React Components

This project is based on the [AI SDK UI Streaming React Components](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/streaming-react-components)

# AI SDK UI: Streaming React Components

The RSC API allows you to stream React components from the server to the client with the streamUI function. This is useful when you want to go beyond raw text and stream components to the client in real-time.

Similar to AI SDK Core APIs (like streamText and streamObject ), streamUI provides a single function to call a model and allow it to respond with React Server Components. It supports the same model interfaces as AI SDK Core APIs.
