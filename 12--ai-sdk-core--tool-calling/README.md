# AI SDK Core Generating Structured Data

This project is based on the [AI SDK Core Generating Structured Data](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data)

The AI SDK standardises structured object generation across model providers with the generateObject and streamObject functions. You can use both functions with different output strategies, e.g. array, object, or no-schema, and with different generation modes, e.g. auto, tool, or json. You can use Zod schemas or JSON schemas to specify the shape of the data that you want, and the AI model will generate data that conforms to that structure.
